Ocean is a complex environment, and species will face survival issue under climate change scenario. The seagrass ecosystem in GBR plays an important role as a buffer between adjacent coastal river catchment inputs and reef communities, protecting the reefs from pollution and toxic substances (McKenzie et al.,2020). Based on that, analysed how extreme event influence deep seagrass growth by three variables (in Great Barrier Reef from 2016 to 2019 in four study sites. 

Research question: how extreme climatic factors influence seagrass growth rates

Summary of the analysis
1)	We would test the relationships between climatic elements and deep seagrass growth rate.
2)	Calculating the anomaly value from 2016-2019 and extract a period of extreme event in this period.
3)	Calculating the correlation of anomaly value between different variables.
